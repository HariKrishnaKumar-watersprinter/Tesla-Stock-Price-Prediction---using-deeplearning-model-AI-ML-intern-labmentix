An industry-grade, end-to-end quantitative framework for predicting Tesla (TSLA) stock prices using advanced Deep Learning architectures (SimpleRNN, LSTM, Transformer). This project features a complete pipeline from high-frequency data wrangling and 20-chart interactive EDA to hyperparameter-tuned multi-horizon forecasting and SHAP-based model explainability, all deployed within a professional Streamlit dashboard.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The stock market, particularly high-growth equities like Tesla (TSLA), is characterized by extreme volatility, non-linear dynamics, and complex temporal dependencies. Traditional statistical models (e.g., ARIMA) often fail to capture these intricate patterns. Furthermore, deep learning models in finance are frequently treated as "black boxes," making it difficult for quantitative analysts to trust and interpret the driving factors behind predictions. 

This project addresses these challenges by developing a robust, multi-horizon deep learning framework capable of capturing sequential dependencies, optimizing hyperparameters systematically via GridSearchCV, and providing explainable, actionable insights using SHAP values.
